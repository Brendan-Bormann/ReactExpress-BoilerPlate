# React-Express Boiler-Plate

My personal React Express boiler plate. Made to help get up and running quickly on new MERN stack projects.

## Getting Started

When starting a new project, clone this repo with the link above and install the node modules.

Once ready begin by running:
`npm start`

To build the react app and test the full site, run:
`npm build`
This command will build the React app and then run the server.

## Built With

* [Create-React-App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) - Front-End Tech
* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) - Dependency Management
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - Routing
